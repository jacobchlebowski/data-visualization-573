Title: Olympic Gender Gap Narrows as Women's Participation Surges
Chart Author: Deepali Kank

What kind of data is it? Tabular? Network? Tree? Multidimensional?

Last week I took a look at the Olympic Gender Gap Women's Participation data visualization chart. Based on the textbook (Visualization Analysis and Design), a tabular dataset is "made up of rows and columns." This chart that I analyzed is indeed a tabular dataset type because each row corresponds with a year and each column corresponds to a percentage (for M and F participants). However, this graph is still unique in that it's more of a "pyramid-like" structure similar to that of a "pyramid-plot" dataset [1]. On an unrelated note, the dataset type is static since it is not updating with real-time changes and are per year.

How can the various attributes be characterized? For each attribute shown, is it Quantitative? Categorical?

The attributes associated with this chart is the number of M and F participants, which is then translated into percentages on a visual scale. This is because the number of participants can be "measured, observed, and logged" (based on the textbook definition of an attribute). This particular attribute is CATEGORICALLY devised by M and F, though there is also a QUANTITATIVE attribute type since the M and F's are compared, but also they are compared based on quantitative data. Furthermore, the ORDERING DIRECTION of this attribute seems to look "diverging" even though the graph scales in one direction... A mix of both perhaps.

Feel free to leave any comments on this! I'm relatively new to most of these terms so if I'm using them incorrectly let me know.
