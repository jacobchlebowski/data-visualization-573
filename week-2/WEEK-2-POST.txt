Hi everyone,

Per the Professors request to send everything in one message so that Discord is less clogged, here is my work for Week 2.

``` Find 3 Datasets ```

My 3 Viz Datasets (Kaggle.com has some neat csv files):
1) Cost of Living by Country - https://vizhub.com/jacobchlebowski/cost-of-living-by-country-dataset
2) Pok√©mon Base Stats - https://vizhub.com/jacobchlebowski/pokemon-base-stats-dataset
3) Global Population Growth 2024 - https://vizhub.com/jacobchlebowski/global-population-growth-2024

Note: I've also added a scrollbar to all of my programs for optimal viewing experience

``` Analyze Current Events Viz Data ```



``` Ask a Question ```
