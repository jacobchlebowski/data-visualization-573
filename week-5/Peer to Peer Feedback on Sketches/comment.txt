Hi Samy, I really like your initial sketch for your World Happiness Map. I think doing this digitally is way better than doing it by hand (which was the mistake I made, because its just so much clearer to see digitally). Right off the bat, I'm seeing a world map where the larger circles represent more happiness and the smaller ones represent less happiness, so that message gets across (which is great!). I think there's something to be said about the population of the areas with happiness as well. I know that may not be within the original dataset, but it would be cool to see potentially different symbols/shapes (Identity channels) that represent areas that are more populated than others. For example, a star may represent a population of over 300,000+ where a square represents a population in an area with over 5 million people. Another thing that you might be able to pursue if the population is a bit more difficult to gauge is an opacity/saturation (Magnitude channels) based on the number of circles that represent an area. So for example, you might be able to alter the opacity of the circles within the more condensed areas a bit more, so the visualization can clearly represent the volume of population/happiness within that area. Australia in particular seems to have a lot of that.
