Hi Stephen. Nice choice with the dataset. I almost went with this one, but I also think most people would be interested in, and can benefit from this visualization since the cost of living within the US (at least in my opinion) has gone up tremendously in the past 10 years alone. However, I'm excited to see what that looks like in other countries and how you might visualize that.

Good first sketch. Yes! Combining 2 datasets (salary and cost of living) is a really unique way to visualize something new. Disparage between cost of living and median salary can be visualized with the color gradient as you present in your iteration, but I also wonder if in your final project, you can include not just the top 10 countries, but every country. Perhaps your graph could be dynamic where an end-user types in a country, and it displays that country within the graph? For example, user types in "Nepal" and Nepal's graph shows up in #5 (if you still want to only show 10 at a time), but its surrounded by 4 countries of higher cost of living, and 5 of lower cost of living (and median salaries). Otherwise, you can implement a horizontal scroll bar that scrolls all the way through the disparities for every country in your dataset. This is a simple, yet effective visualization tool so the user can truly see all of the data.

Nice Viz for cost of living by country. Yup combining your bar chart and line chart into one graph would be awesome. Perhaps your first milestone could be doing that, and then any additional work (i.e. clicking on a bar to display more info) could be future milestones.

Sounds like you have a good handle on this project based on your viz work so far, so feel free to use (or not use) any of my recommendations!
