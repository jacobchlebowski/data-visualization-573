# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a
[Pokémon Base Stats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crinklybrain2003/pokmon-base-stats-dataset),
which consists of most (if not all) Pokémon. Each Pokémon
has an associated list of attributes, which includes a:

- Name
- Type
- Species
- Height
- Weight
- Abilities
- Catch Rate
- Base Friendship
- Base Exp.
- Growth Rate
- Gender
- HP (Hit Points)
- Attack
- Defense
- Sp. Atk
- Sp. Def
- Speed

The reason I really like this dataset is because of the
number of features for each Pokémon, and gives me a creative
outlet for visualizing this data in a unique way. **Who is
this for? What will it enable them to do?** Well, this
visualization can be for gamers and game
developers/designers alike. The data can help gamers pick
out a good lineup, depending on what kind of Pokémon they
prefer. On the other hand, game developers may want to study
the balance in character design. After all, it's rare for a
Pokémon to have all of the best abilities. **My project** in
particular will primarily facilitate the visualization of
speed and attack vectors, while also including Pokémon type
and HP attributes as well. So far, I have come to the
conclusion to present this data in a scatterplot, though I
have gone through some other iterations such as a bubble
chart and a radar chart.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the
visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

- How does the Pokémon's speed correlate with its offensive stats?
- Is there a correlation between a Pokémon's HP and Speed?
- What can the Pokémon type tell us about the Speed of that type compared to all other Pokémon (if anything)?
- What can the Pokémon type tell us about the HP of that type compared to all other Pokémon (if anything)?
- What can each quadrant of the scatterplot tell us about all Pokémon? Are they evenly distributed? Are there any outliers?


The ultimate aim of these questions is to unravel any answers as to how the Pokémon are distributed so that gamers and game developers alike can benefit from this design or game strategy.
